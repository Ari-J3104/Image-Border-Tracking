# Image-Border-Tracking

This program was created in Binghamton's Research Immersion Program. The goal of this project is to take an image full of shapes and find the border of the shape. 

To run the program, download both ASG3Image.png and Aryan_JainASG3.py. Then, on the command line, enter "python Aryan_JainASG3.py".
