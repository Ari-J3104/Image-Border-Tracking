# Image-Border-Tracking

This program was created in Binghamton's Research Immersion Program. The goal of this project is to take an image full of shapes and find the border of the shape. 

To run the program, download both ASG3Image.png and Aryan_JainASG3.py. Then, on the command line, enter "python Aryan_JainASG3.py". 

3 images will be displayed, called "image1", "image3", and "image4".

First, click inside any shape in image1, wait a little bit to let the program load, and then you'll see the shape that was clicked in image1 pop up in image4. Then, drag image1 and image4 so that you can see them both. Image4 shows that we have kept track of the shape that was clicked, as well as all of the corners of that shape as well.
